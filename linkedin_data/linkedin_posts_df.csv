I want to share an experience that happened yesterday highlighting this....💻 My friend reached out to learn about the data space as he is preparing for a big interview. I spent 30 minutes explaining what's considered ""the modern data stack"", but the most important conversation happened at the end.🧐 I asked, ""Do you have any constructive feedback for me? I want to do more public speaking on the topic of data, and I would love to know what worked and didn't for our conversation.""🎤 He informed me that the way I emphasize certain words when I speak was extremely helpful in learning a new topic.🤯 MY MIND WAS BLOWN, as it informed me of a strength that 1) I was completely unaware of, and 2) I can further refine.📈 Asking for feedback may make you feel vulnerable at first, but in the long run it will provide you key insights for long term success. Some feedback is amazing (both positive and constructive), and other feedback can be lacking. Regardless, someone going out if their comfort zone to give feedback is a major gift.#OnTheMarkData #feedback #learning #success #growth #data #dataanalytics #datascience #dataengineering #datascientists #dataanalyst #dataengineer #mlengineer #ml #ai #machinelearning",2d,2021-07-17,22,2,2,966.0,19.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,0

Even within each flavor, there are different types of data scientist which are dependent on a company's data maturity. Below is how I think about data scientist that build data products:💡1. The Initiator- Able to take abstract ideas, create structure to a problem, and deliver the first iteration.- Leans into turning a vision into action, while not chasing perfection.📈 2. The Grower- Focuses on taking new data products to the next level.- Strength is the ability to identify the ""signal in the noise"" to help inform how a data product can impact the most users.⚙️ 3.

Thus, I decided to call the university to see my options.This phone call resulted in me being berated for fifteen minutes straight by two admissions officers. They questioned my intelligence, work ethic, and capabilities as a person. The words that cut the deepest though were ""We don't think you are fit to be a doctor.""From that point on I decided that I was going to become a doctor to prove them wrong. Unfortunately, this set me on a path filled with unneeded stress and heartache.Most of my academic career was centered around proving two people wrong, rather than pursuing my passions. Every pursuit wasn't good enough and every failure was blown out of proportion.It wasn't until I was a student at Stanford Med where I realized I lost my passion of becoming a doctor years ago-- I was just trying to prove them wrong.

This week we are talking about the ~$160B gaming industry!🎮 I recently watched a video where employees from Wildlife Studios shared how they use machine learning at scale to power their multitude of mobile games (link to the video in my profile's linktree page 🔗🌲).👇🏽 They presented TWO main use cases that I thought were interesting:🚰 1. You need infrastructure for streaming data.▪️ The gaming industry is unique in that it has a significant amount of streaming data where every click and action is recorded. Just think about all the clicks you do in just 15 minutes, now scale that to millions of users! This requires some intense data engineering and cloud infrastructure skills to collect and prepare the data for analytics.💰 2. For mobile games, a small proportion of users drive most of the revenue.▪️ For Wildlife Studios:- 60% of revenue comes from in-game purchases.- Yet 95% of users have never made a purchase.▪️ This is such an interesting data and business problem! A data professional in this role would need to determine how to segment their users into those who would purchase and not purchase. Then among those who would purchase, determine which in-game product would be the best to present to the user at the right time. This problem is a perfect use case for ML!👾 I highly encourage checking out the video as they go in-depth in their tech stack and the ML models they use!#OnTheMarkData #MondayMotivation #ml #startups #dataanalysis, #datascientists #dataengineering #data #ai #datascience #dataanalytics #machinelearning #r #python #sql #gaming #mobilegames #gameindustry",3w,2021-06-28,23,3,6,1743.0,19.0,0,0,0,0,4.0

These questions definitely reminded me of grad school where I learned why behavior change is SO HARD.Below is one of my favorite models I learned:The Transtheoretical Model consists of 6 stages that last ~6 months and provides a framework of one's behavior change journey (link to learn more in my profile's linktree page).1.Precontemplation: Not planning to make behavior change.2. Contemplation: Planning to start a new behavior in the future.3. Preparation (Determination): Preparing to take action on a new behavior within the next 30 days.4. Action: Have changed behavior and plan to continue.5. Maintenance: Changed behavior for greater than 6 months.6. Relapse/Termination: One will either maintain the new behavior indefinitely or drop the behavior.Though intended for health behaviors, this process definitely mimicked my journey of becoming a data scientist and building the consistency to develop my data skills.

In our last meeting, I asked how she has been able to get buy-in on so many ideas that ultimately turn into features within our product.👇🏽 Below are the two skills she said are key to her success:🎯 1. She is constantly talking to colleagues outside of her team (e.g. Sales, UX, Design, etc.) to learn about their pain points and hear moments where they say ""I wish I had XYZ..."" More importantly, she informed us that many of the ideas are not hers, but rather she curates conversations to find patterns and suggestions to act on.🎬 2. She has a bias towards action! Many individuals have ideas, but very few actually act on the ideas to get momentum behind them. Specifically, when she identifies an idea she aims to build a proof of concept in ~2 weeks and then get feedback.

This week we are talking about predictive maintenance!🛠️ Predictive maintenance is the application of machine learning to predict when a machine component will fail by using telemetry data.🚘 Example: If you own a car, then you know you have to change its oil roughly every ~6000 miles if you don't want issues. This rough estimate is okay for your personal car, but if you are a business with a fleet of vehicles, this estimate can end up being costly! You may be overpaying by servicing too early or have surprise costs due to catastrophic failures.🤖 By using predictive maintenance, a business can optimize its repair schedule to get the most out of its machines while also lowering the yearly cost of repairs. Furthermore, such an application of ML can also spot anomalies of telemetry data to potentially identify dangerous failures as well.💡 Here are few great examples to learn more about this use case:- AWS conference example: https://buff.ly/34FUDxz- Mining industry example: https://buff.ly/3c6yehi- Case study from industry: https://buff.ly/34Acfek#DataHustle #data #datascience #ai #ml #predictivemaintenance #machinelearning #telemetry",1mo,2021-06-19,17,1,3,856.0,11.0,0,0,0,1.0,5.0

Specifically it highlighted the ""3 Layer Framework,"" which consists of:1) Data Flow Layer - ETL/ELT, data analytics and visualization, etc.2) Metadata Layer - schema, orchestration, auditing, etc.3) Devops Tooling Layer - authoring, testing, deploying, and monitoringWhat's interesting is that most articles focus on the Data Flow Layer, but this article highlights that one should focus on the Metadata Layer first. Furthermore, the Metadata Layer should drive your whole data strategy!I highly encourage reading this article if you want to learn more, as it's answered a lot of my questions about my job's data stack and how it can mature.#OnTheMarkData #DataHustle #datascience #data #dataanalytics #dataengineering #dataarchitecture #etl #elt #datalake #datawarehouse #lakehouse #metadata #python #r #sql",1mo,2021-06-19,17,3,6,2748.0,13.0,0,0,0,0,4.0

To address this, my current manager provided an amazing nudge to shift my focus from solving ""data problems"" to instead solving ""business problems."" This minor shift in perspective made a huge difference.🤔 Recently I did a project analyzing one of our product channels that would help our VP of Product make a decision. In the scoping and data analysis plan phase I asked the following:👉🏽 ""What was the context that drove this request, and how does it relate to the business's overall goal?""🧪 My stakeholder's response completely changed the direction of the analysis for the better. The initial broad request quickly turned into three distinct business hypotheses that needed to be evaluated.💪🏽 From that conversation, I was able to directly connect my work to the overall business goal. All of which wouldn't have been possible if I only delivered on the initial request as is.📈 As a data scientist, you must understand that data can be very abstract. Thus, it's on us as the data expert to help connect the dots with our stakeholders to get to the real request.#OnTheMarkData #DataHustle #WednesdayWork #WednesdayWisdom #datascience #dataanalytics #data #ml #ai #r #python #sql #analytics",1mo,2021-06-19,25,3,4,1552.0,17.0,1.0,0,1.0,0,6.0

Electronic Health Records (EHR) - the notes your doctor takes about you during visits, which includes structured data and text data. 💸  2. Insurance Claims - Information of what diagnosis were made, procedures conducted, and the costs/reimbursements associated with a visit.💪🏽  What makes this space so challenging (read: FUN) is that every hospital has a different way of capturing data, making data cleaning and preparation a very important step. In addition, data is very siloed making it hard to get a ""full"" picture at times.👇🏽  But these challenges are worth it as here are some of the cool things you can do:▪️ Monitoring of diseases at scale▪️ Precision medicine (i.e. medical care tailored to the individual)▪️ Medical decision support via AI▪️ Cost and care optimization▪️ Real world evidence studies (e.g. does new drugs or procedures work outside of a research setting)🙌🏽  Check out the comments below where I share different job description in the space!#DataHustle #TuesdayTours #data #datascience #dataanalytics #ai #ml #medicine #healthcare #health #digitalhealth #healthtech #python #r #sql",1mo,2021-06-19,54,12,20,2675.0,45.0,4.0,0,1.0,0,4.0

Many webcams are subpar, are not consistent across computers, and the high end webcams often lack the ability to control white balance (i.e. natural video color).2. Action cameras, such as the Insta360 pictured below, are now adding webcam capabilities via firmware updates. They boast the ability to provide 4k picture quality with buttery smooth 60 fps-- unfortunately this was far from the truth when trying it out (pictured below).3. The pros who take streaming very seriously are using expensive DSLR cameras hooked to their computer via HDMI video capture adapters. DSLR cameras allow you to customize focus and white balance to give you production quality video.4. A great entry point for amazing video quality, without the high cost of a DSLR camera, is to actually use your smartphone! I'm currently using the Filmic Pro app on a Iphone 11, which connects to my computer via an HDMI video capture adapter (pictured below).

This is amazing, but it does have some drawbacks.Similar to how you wouldn't just accept any model, you should hold the same expectation for the packages you use. Some things to check out when considering a ML package:- Is the package used in production or created by any reputable companies (can find this out typically through blogs)?- When was the package last updated and what does it's open source community look like?- Are there any papers or conference presentations that detail the creation or use of the package (e.g. arXiv)?- Can you find potential benchmarking comparing the package to the current industry standard?Recently, I found a really cool package but went through the above questions first before considering it for my sentiment analysis project at work.Even more exciting, I came across a blog that provides a great critique of the package and the blog/package authors go back and forth in the comments in a constructive way! (link in comments)It served as a great reminder of the ""science"" in data science and how we should engage in peer review and checking nuanced considerations!#DataHustle #datascience #python #r #data #ml #nlp",2mo,2021-05-20,29,1,4,3945.0,27.0,0,0,0,0,2.0

The stakeholder knows what they want (or the challenge they are facing), but communicating this need is difficult as data can be so abstract. Thus, your expertise in data can help guide stakeholders to the ""real"" request they had in mind-- and make your ability to drive value a lot easier.One of my favorite tools to help get to the ""real"" request is... Paint!  Below is a mockup I created today for a recent request (changed title and keys). Rather than spending time coding unknowns, I create quick mockups of expected graphs and ask the stakeholder ""does this align with your expectations?""You will either get ""Wow! That looks great,"" or ""Hmm, now that I see it I believe I meant this...""This approach has the following benefits:1. Requesting and implementing stakeholder feedback builds trust in your solution.2. You get ahead of ""gotchas"" and dead ends before you are deep into a project.3. You move the conversation from abstract ideas to tangible requests.#DataHustle #datascience #mockup #data #datanalytics",3mo,2021-04-20,35,3,4,3360.0,29.0,1.0,0,2.0,0,3.0

In my opinion, the tool that leads ahead is SQL. As I have grown as a data scientist, so has my love for SQL!Here are my top 3 reasons why SQL is awesome:1) It's amazing for quickly prototyping various logic for data projects-- especially when your data comes from multiple sources. I often find interesting quirks in our data when doing my initial SQL exploration. I then account for those nuances when I start writing code for production or analyses.2) SQL has been around for a LONG time and is part of most businesses. No matter what org you go to, your SQL skills will be useful for navigating their database. Whether you join an R or Python team, SQL will most likely be part of the mix.3) With cloud computing, SQL is more important than ever. The cloud has reduced the financial burden of creating a data warehouse to a fraction of the cost, while also reducing the time to set one up from months to minutes. In addition, storing data within data warehouses has become considerably cheaper. A great way to access this data is through SQL!What are some of your favorite things about SQL?#DataHustle #python  #sql  #r  #datascience #data #analytics #dataanalytics",3mo,2021-04-20,60,9,17,1964.0,54.0,0,0,4.0,0,2.0

This book provided a great intro to data engineering at a high level. This will serve as a strong foundation as I dive deeper into my next book.💎 Here are my TOP FOUR takeaways from this book:☁️ 1) The rise of cloud computing and subsequent improvements to data warehouses has led the shift from ETL to ELT pipelines. More importantly, a lot of tooling emphasize on either data ingestion (i.e. E - extraction and L - load) or data transformation (i.e. the T)🎺 2) On top of data ingestion and transformation, you need to orchestrate the steps in your pipeline, which can be very complex. A tool to visualize these steps is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A great open source tool for orchestration is Apache Airflow.🔧 3) An amazing open source tool for transformations is Data Build Tool (DBT) as it both handles transformations AND orchestrating transformation steps. In addition, you are able to standardize your transformation logic and have version control.🪵 4) Logging is essential to both monitor and maintain your ELT pipeline, and should have its own separate pipeline. Use these logs to create 3-5 strong metrics to track your pipeline.#DataHustle #datascience #ELT #ETL #dataengineer #data",4mo,2021-03-21,27,2,3,1245.0,22.0,0,0,0,0,5.0

After a couple hours I finally got a ""yes"" from a hair salon AND I SHAKED THAT SIGN LIKE MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT!A week later I went back to the businesses that said ""no"" and told them ""you see me shaking a sign for the salon on your street, I can do it for you too."" I eventually had three sign shaking gigs, was making more money than my previous food job, and my arms became super toned as a bonus 😅!This was so formative for me because it showed that I can put myself out there and make anything happen.

I especially loved the following quote:""Domain knowledge is essential to validating the assumptions. Unlike other forms of inference (e.g. a basic linear regression), many of the assumptions we discussed for the methods above cannot be computational or visually assessed (e.g. not like the quintessential residual or QQ plots). Instead, assumptions rely largely and careful attention to detail combined with intuition and background knowledge from one’s domain. This means causal inference should necessarily be a human-in-the-loop activity.""#DataHustle #causalinference #stats #statistics #researchmethodology #observational #datascience #dataanalytics #analytics #r",4mo,2021-03-21,21,1,1,1041.0,20.0,0,0,0,0,1.0

(Outbound Sales)I cold called and emailed law professors and tried to talk them into putting in a good word for me. (Inside Sales/ABM)I even flew into Chicago, stayed at a cheap hotel, just to meet with a member of the admissions staff in person to make my case. (Field Sales)I sent follow up emails and letters to everyone I spoke with over and over again. (Lead Nurture)Nine months later, the offer letter arrived in my email inbox. I was in!

That year I had a mental breakdown, and was ultimately diagnosed with having OCD. For me, my symptoms typically look like mentally checking EVERYTHING or going on 48 hour work binges to get things ""perfect"". The habits I thought got me into Stanford, were actually the ones destroying my life.This event was a blessing in disguise, as it finally put me on a path to address the habits that brought me so much suffering. Today, I'm in a much better place due to all the work I put into therapy, my amazing wife, and my supportive family and friends.Even with the past few weeks being rough for me, my worst days today are 100x better than my best days in 2018. Here are three lessons that helped get me there:1) Know what your 100% capacity is (e.g. sum of work, hanging out, etc.) and bring yourself down to 75%. This gives me a buffer when things are rough to prevent burnout.2) Embrace discomfort and face your fears! Mental health challenges often makes discomfort extreme, but getting comfortable with being uncomfortable has helped silence the OCD voice.3) Treat self compassion as a lifestyle. Actively reframing thoughts within a self compassion lense dramatically reduced the burden of mental health.#DataHustle #MentalHealth",4mo,2021-03-21,249,10,14,12991.0,156.0,5.0,44.0,44.0,0,0

We now have comments mapping to report insights via NLP.💎  This has been the most ambitious project I have worked on since becoming a data scientist, and I have learned so much. Here are my TOP 3 lessons:1️⃣  Know when you are doing data science project or a product building project that uses data science. The data science workflow is very linear, but when building products you have to instead think about the quickest path for a v1 and expand.2️⃣  Object oriented programming is powerful, and a must for putting data science applications into production. A great use case are custom transformers within sklearn, which was utilized for placing text data preprocessing within a pipeline.3️⃣  Learn how to quickly identify when you need to ask for help. Putting a model into production was so new to me that I didn't know what I didn't know, and made it hard to know when to ask. This realization will be so helpful for future projects.👇🏽 This is only a small part of our new text analytics features.

It’s surprisingly not fancy tech or ML models, rather it’s partnering with business stakeholders and domain experts!💎 Here are my TOP 3 lessons learned from collaborating with Humu’s UX Research Lead, Marieke McCloskey: 🔶 1. Marieke is constantly talking to users and synthesizing this data to highlight highs and lows of our product. These qualitative insights help me quickly identify what are the most impactful business questions to answer with data.🔶 2. Marieke understands our product extremely well, and I understand our data extremely well. Working together allows us to take raw stats and transform them into powerful data stories!🔶 3. Asking the right questions leads to developing the right metrics of success. Marieke’s question of “Who is our most engaged user?” was the catalyst for me to develop our user activity score algorithm. This score is now used by her to measure our product’s health!🎙 Want to learn more?

Ask the ""why"" before building a solution! Determine what's the key business metric, ask for the business context, explore the possibilities and limitations of the proposed hypothesis.2. Building a 1 week MVP is many times better than building the 1 month complex solution. Build a simplified solution, experiment, and then determine if a more complex solution is needed.3. Prioritize for impact! You can build many things for a company, but relentlessly focusing on what solutions drive business impact will help you cut through the noise.#DataHustle #datascience #doordash #analytics #dataanalytics #data #ml #machinelearning",6mo,2021-01-20,40,2,6,8001.0,35.0,3.0,0,0,0,2.0
